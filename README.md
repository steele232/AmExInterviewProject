Following project Instructions from email.

- Step 1 (Complete)
- Step 2 (Complete)
- Step 3 (Not Complete)

Notes on Step 3:

- I ran out of my allotted time here. 
- I was looking into using the Flow API which I've never used before; it looks interesting.
- If I wasn't trying to use the publisher-subscriber pattern, I could've just implemented a simple function call for the System.out call. 
- Another small obstacle that made me choose to stop here was that I have Java 8 installed on my personal computer but the Flow API was introduced in Java 9 and I knew installing Java 9 would take enough time that I should probably stop here.
